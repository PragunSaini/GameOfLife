# GameOfLife

 An imitiation of Conway's Game of life made using Python's game development library [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/ "Pygame")

 #### Rules of the game:
   - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
   - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
   - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
   - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
